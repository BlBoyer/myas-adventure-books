I remembered that when my children Elizabeth and Benjamin were little, I had\r\n      created characters named Hatty and Barty that became their staple of bedtime story fare, for several years\r\n      running. These books- <s-txt>'Maya's Adventures'</s-txt>, are an offshoot from the original series:{' '}\r\n      <s-txt>'Hatty and Barty Adventures'</s-txt>, Month One through Month Twelve. <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      It takes a team to put a book together and I wish to recognize those who have helped to bring this day to\r\n      fruition: <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      First, to my children, <strong>Elizabeth</strong> and <strong>Benjamin</strong>, who were my inspiration for the\r\n      original characters and who made it fun for me to tell bedtime stories. These stories remind me of those many\r\n      nights especially when I came up with the infamous phrase <i-lg>“to be continued”</i-lg>- and the first words out\r\n      of your mouths were: <i-lg>“No dad! Finish it!”</i-lg>\r\n      . <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      Second, to my illustrator, <strong>Aleksandra Adamska Rzepka</strong>. You are an amazingly gifted artist! I am so\r\n      fortunate to have found you and so glad that you agreed to illustrate my books! You are a godsend who brought my\r\n      characters to life with your superb artwork! Thank you so much! <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      Third, to my tireless translators: <strong>Iryna Zimba</strong>, who translated my books into Russian and Ukranian\r\n      and <strong>Auxiliadora Lopez Artola</strong>, who translated my books into Spanish. You are incredible. Thank you\r\n      so much!\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      And finally, to those who read this book and the books that follow this one! Thank you for being part of my world!\r\n      <br />\r\n      <br />\r\n      Grant Boyer\r\n    </p>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"names":["WelcomeStory","_jsxs","children","_jsx"],"sourceRoot":""}
