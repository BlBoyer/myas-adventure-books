I remembered that when my children Elizabeth and Benjamin were little that I had created characters named Hatty and Barty that became their staple of bedtime story fare for several years running. These books; Maya's Adventures are offshoots from the original series; Hatty and Barty Adventures Months One through Month Twelve. It takes a team to put a book together and I wish to recognize those who have helped to bring this day to fruition: First, to my children, Elizabeth and Benjamin who were my inspiration for the original characters and who made it fun for me to tell bedtime stories. These stories remind me of those many nights especially when I came up with the infamous phrase \u201cto be continued\u201d and the first words out of your mouths were \u201cNo dad!\u201d Finish it!\u201d. Second, to my illustrator, Aleksandra Adamska Rzepka. You are an amazingly gifted artist! I am so fortunate to have found you and so glad that you agreed to illustrate my books! You are a godsend who brought my characters to life with your superb artwork! Thank you so much! Third, to my tireless translator, Iryna Zimba you translated my books into two languages, Russian and Ukrainian via your linguistic skills. You are incredible. Thank you so much! Fourth, to Maya herself who presently lives in the war-torn territory of Ukraine. Although these adventures are fictional, your larger than life personality has been an inspiration to me! And finally, to those who read this book and the books that will soon follow this one! Thank you for being part of my world! A trust has been set up called Maya's Adventures Trust where 50% of the net proceeds of sales for the se Maya's Adventure books will go to the real-life Maya and her family.
