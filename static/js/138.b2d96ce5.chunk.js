These were bedtime stories I told my children when they were little. I have experience in professional and legal writing. Since I was a child one of my hobbies was writing poetry. Before formalizing my stories into published books I also edited books for two people, Vladimir Savchuk who wrote the book 'Break Free' and Elena Shelest who wrote the book 'The Seven Lives of Grace'. Maya is a three-year old Eastern European girl with a big personality. She moves to Rigglesnortville, USA with her mom who she affectionately calls Mamochka and her older sister Mira. Maya meets and befriends Hatty and Barty who also live in Rigglesnortville and is first introduced in the Hatty and Barty Adventures Month Eight book. I am so lucky to have found Aleksandra Adamska Rzepka who is an excellent professional illustrator from Poland. She has made my stories come to life in a most amazing way. Her other artwork can be found here. My daughter and sister have provided assistance in editing these books, and my nephew did the cover design work. My son created the websites for these books. Along the way, I also found translators to make these books available in several languages. These books are available in bookstores and on amazon. Grant Boyer"]})}}}]);
