            Several years ago, while editing the book Break Free by Vladimir Savchuk, a thought entered my mind, that I
            should write my own book. I remembered that when my children Elizabeth and Benjamin were little that I had
            created characters named Hatty and Barty that became their staple of bedtime story fare for several years
            running. These books; Maya's Adventures are offshoots from the original series; Hatty and Barty Adventures
            Months One through Month Twelve. It takes a team to put a book together and I wish to recognize those who
            have helped to bring this day to fruition: First, to my children, Elizabeth and Benjamin who were my
            inspiration for the original characters and who made it fun for me to tell bedtime stories. These stories
            remind me of those many nights especially when I came up with the infamous phrase “to be continued” and the
            first words out of your mouths were “No dad!” Finish it!”. Second, to my illustrator, Aleksandra Adamska
            Rzepka. You are an amazingly gifted artist! I am so fortunate to have found you and so glad that you agreed
            to illustrate my books! You are a godsend who brought my characters to life with your superb artwork! Thank
            you so much! Third, to my tireless translator, Iryna Zimba you translated my books into two languages,
            Russian and Ukrainian via your linguistic skills. You are incredible. Thank you so much! Fourth, to Maya
            herself who presently lives in the war-torn territory of Ukraine. Although these adventures are fictional,
            your larger than life personality has been an inspiration to me! And finally, to those who read this book
            and the books that will soon follow this one! Thank you for being part of my world! A trust has been set up
            called Maya's Adventures Trust where 50% of the net proceeds of sales for the se Maya's Adventure books will
            go to the real-life Maya and her family. Grant Boyer
