      . These were bedtime stories I told my children when they were little. I have experience in professional and legal
      writing. Since I was a child one of my hobbies was writing poetry. Before formalizing my stories into published
      books I also edited books for two people, <strong>Vladimir Savchuk</strong> who wrote the book{' '}
      <em>'Break Free'</em> and <strong>Elena Shelest</strong> who wrote the book <em>'The Seven Lives of Grace'</em>.
      <br />I am so lucky to have found <strong>Aleksandra Adamska Rzepka</strong> who is an excellent professional
      illustrator from Poland. She has made my stories come to life in a most amazing way. Her other artwork can be
      found <a href=''>here</a>. My daughter and sister have provided assistance in editing these books, and my nephew
      did the cover design work. My son created the websites for these books. Along the way, I also found translators to
      make these books available in several languages. These books are available in bookstores and on{' '}
      <a href=''>amazon</a>.
