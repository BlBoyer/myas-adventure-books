      Several years ago, while editing the book <em>Break Free- by Vladimir Savchuk</em>, a thought entered my mind,
      that I should write my own book. I remembered that when my children Elizabeth and Benjamin were little, I had
      created characters named Hatty and Barty that became their staple of bedtime story fare, for several years
      running. These books- <s-txt>'Maya's Adventures'</s-txt>, are offshoots from the original series:{' '}
      <s-txt>'Hatty and Barty Adventures'</s-txt>, Month One through Month Twelve. <br />
      <br />
      It takes a team to put a book together and I wish to recognize those who have helped to bring this day to
      fruition: <br />
      <br />
      First, to my children, <strong>Elizabeth</strong> and <strong>Benjamin</strong>, who were my inspiration for the
      original characters and who made it fun for me to tell bedtime stories. These stories remind me of those many
      nights especially when I came up with the infamous phrase <i-lg>“to be continued”</i-lg>- and the first words out
      of your mouths were: <i-lg>“No dad! Finish it!”</i-lg>
      . <br />
      <br />
      Second, to my illustrator, <strong>Aleksandra Adamska Rzepka</strong>. You are an amazingly gifted artist! I am so
      fortunate to have found you and so glad that you agreed to illustrate my books! You are a godsend who brought my
      characters to life with your superb artwork! Thank you so much! <br />
      <br />
      Third, to my tireless translator, <strong>Iryna Zimba</strong> you translated my books into two languages, Russian
      and Ukrainian via your linguistic skills. You are incredible. Thank you so much!
      <br />
      <br />
      And finally- to those who read this book and the books that follow this one! Thank you for being part of my world!
      <br />
